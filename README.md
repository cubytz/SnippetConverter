Simple command-line tool to convert Sublime Text Snippets to Visual Studio Code format

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'snippet_converter'
```

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install snippet_converter

## Usage

### Simple conversion

Convert a snippet to json

```
snippet_converter -f PATH_TO_SUBLIME_SNIPPET
```

This will create a `snippets/snippets.json` file in the current working directory.

**Keep original filename**

Pass the split `-s` option to keep the original filename.

### Bulk conversion

**Convert selected files**

Convert multiple files by passing a comma seperated list to the `-f` option

```
snippet_converter -f 'PATH_TO_FILE,PATH_TO_FILE,...'
```

**Convert content of directory**

Convert a folder by using the `-d` option

```
snippet_converter -d PATH_TO_DIRECTORY
```

**Split files**

Pass the split `-s` option to split the output in multiple files

### Output directory

Set the output directory by passing the `-o` option

```
snippet_converter -f PATH_TO_SNIPPET_FILE -o PATH_TO_OUTPUT_FOLDER
```

For all available options, see `-h` or `--help` for details
